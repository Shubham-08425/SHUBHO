    question: "Which of the following best explains the formation of delta regions?",
    options: [
      "Deposition of sediments at river mouth due to decreased velocity",
      "Erosion caused by fast flowing rivers",
      "Volcanic activity near the coast",
      "Strong sea currents washing away sediments"
    ],
    answer: 0,
    explanation: "Deltas form by deposition of sediments when a river slows down as it meets a sea or ocean."
  },
  {
    question: "Why is the Indian monsoon considered a complex climatic phenomenon?",
    options: [
      "Because it depends on only the Arabian Sea",
      "Because it involves seasonal wind reversal, interaction of land, sea, and mountains",
      "Because it is a constant dry wind",
      "Because it occurs only once in 5 years"
    ],
    answer: 1,
    explanation: "The monsoon results from complex interaction of land heating, ocean currents, wind patterns, and mountain ranges."
  },
  {
    question: "Which factors influence the distribution of population in India?",
    options: [
      "Climate, availability of water, and soil fertility",
      "Only economic factors",
      "Only political stability",
      "None of the above"
    ],
    answer: 0,
