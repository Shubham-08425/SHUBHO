      "It boosts economic growth but increases unemployment risks",
      "It reduces the working-age population and increases dependency ratio",
      "It leads to higher literacy but lower productivity"
    ],
    answer: 1,
    explanation: "Demographic dividend means more working-age people, which can boost growth if employed, but if jobs aren‚Äôt created, it causes unemployment and social strain."
  },
  {
    question: "Why is the informal sector often referred to as a ‚Äòlow productivity sector‚Äô despite employing the majority of the workforce in India?",
    options: [
      "Lack of access to advanced technology and finance",
      "High wages and job security",
      "Strong government regulation",
      "High investment in infrastructure"

    options: [
      "GDP includes all transactions including black money",

      "GDP is calculated only annually",
      "GDP counts imports as economic growth"

  },
  {
    question: "How does the introduction of mechanization in agriculture affect rural employment?",

      "Creates more permanent jobs",
      "Eliminates seasonal unemployment",
      "May reduce labor demand causing unemployment",
      "Has no effect on employment"
    ],
    answer: 2,
    explanation: "Mechanization replaces manual labor, reducing demand for workers and increasing unemployment unless alternative jobs are created."
  },
  {
    question: "Why is the service sector considered the backbone of India‚Äôs GDP growth but not employment generation?",
    options: [
      "It requires highly skilled workers but employs few",
      "It is mainly government jobs",
      "It produces low-value goods",
      "It is a small part of the economy"
    ],
    answer: 0,
    explanation: "Service sector growth is driven by capital and technology, employing skilled workers, and doesn‚Äôt create as many jobs as agriculture or manufacturing."
  },
  {
    question: "Which factor primarily limits the expansion of the organized sector in India?",
    options: [
      "High informal sector wages",
      "Strict labor laws and high operational costs",
      "Lack of raw materials",
      "Low demand for goods"
    ],
    answer: 1,
    explanation: "Rigid labor laws, costs of compliance, and taxes limit organized sector growth, pushing many businesses to informal."
  },
  {
    question: "In the context of economic planning, what is the significance of 'priority sector lending'?",

      "Inflation reduces prices of essentials",
      "Poor are unaffected by inflation"
    ],
    answer: 0,

  },
  {
    question: "Why is diversification of livelihood important in rural India?",
    options: [
      "It increases dependence on farming",
      "It reduces risks and improves income security",
      "It lowers the quality of life",

      "Growth in agriculture only",
