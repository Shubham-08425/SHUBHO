const questions = [
  {
    question: "Why does disguised unemployment pose a challenge to measuring true employment levels in Indian agriculture?",
    options: [
      "It leads to underestimation of agricultural productivity",
      "Workers appear employed but contribute no marginal output",
      "It inflates urban unemployment figures",
      "It includes all seasonal workers as unemployed"
    ],
    answer: 1,
    explanation: "Disguised unemployment refers to workers who are employed but whose marginal productivity is zero or negligible, meaning they don't add to total output but appear as employed."
  },
  {
    question: "How does the Human Development Index (HDI) provide a better measure of economic progress than GDP alone?",
    options: [
      "It includes income distribution patterns",
      "It incorporates income, education, and life expectancy",
      "It accounts for inflation rates",
      "It measures only poverty levels"
    ],
    answer: 1,
    explanation: "HDI combines income, education, and life expectancy to provide a holistic view of development, unlike GDP which measures just economic output."
  },
  {
    question: "What is the primary reason behind the slow growth of the manufacturing sector in India despite high economic growth?",
    options: [
      "Lack of natural resources",
      "Inadequate infrastructure and regulatory bottlenecks",
      "Insufficient consumer demand",
      "Low labor force participation"
    ],
    answer: 1,
    explanation: "Infrastructure problems, complex regulations, and labor laws restrict manufacturing expansion despite overall economic growth."
  },
  {
    question: "How does inflation affect different income groups in India disproportionately?",
    options: [
      "Richer groups suffer more due to fixed incomes",
      "Poor groups suffer more due to higher spending on essentials",
      "Inflation benefits all equally",
      "Only the middle class is affected"
    ],
    answer: 1,
    explanation: "Inflation increases prices of essential goods, which form a larger portion of poor households‚Äô expenditure, reducing their real income more than the rich."
  },
  {
    question: "Why is diversification of income sources important for rural households?",
    options: [
      "It helps reduce vulnerability to agricultural risks",
      "It increases dependency on farming",
      "It reduces migration to cities",
      "It decreases total income"
    ],
    answer: 0,
    explanation: "Diversifying income by including non-farm activities reduces risk from crop failures and stabilizes rural incomes."
  },
  {
    question: "What is the major limitation of GDP as an indicator of economic welfare?",
    options: [
      "Excludes income from the informal sector",
      "Does not account for income inequality and non-market activities",
      "Is difficult to calculate",
      "Does not measure government spending"
    ],
    answer: 1,
    explanation: "GDP ignores income distribution and unpaid work such as household chores, limiting its usefulness for welfare assessment."
  },
  {
    question: "How does globalization impact the Indian labor market?",
    options: [
      "Eliminates all unskilled jobs",
      "Creates employment opportunities but may displace some workers",
      "Has no effect on employment",
      "Only benefits the agricultural sector"
    ],
    answer: 1,
    explanation: "Globalization creates jobs in sectors like IT and services but can displace unskilled workers in traditional industries."
  },
  {
    question: "Why is priority sector lending essential for the Indian economy?",
    options: [
      "Ensures credit flow to agriculture, MSMEs and vulnerable sectors",
      "Reduces interest rates for all loans",
      "Limits loans to organized sectors",
      "Promotes foreign investment"
    ],
    answer: 0,
    explanation: "Priority sector lending supports sectors vital for inclusive growth but underserved by banks otherwise."
  },
  {
    question: "What is meant by ‚Äòjobless growth‚Äô?",
    options: [
      "Economic growth with little or no increase in employment",
      "Employment growth with no economic growth",
      "Growth only in agricultural jobs",
      "Growth limited to rural areas"
    ],
    answer: 0,
    explanation: "‚ÄòJobless growth‚Äô means the economy grows but fails to generate adequate employment opportunities."
  },
  {
    question: "How does the informal sector contribute to the Indian economy?",
    options: [
      "Generates high tax revenues",
      "Provides employment to a large workforce with low capital",
      "Ensures high wages and job security",
      "Dominates the service sector"
    ],
    answer: 1,
    explanation: "The informal sector employs a large share of India‚Äôs workforce but is characterized by low wages and lack of social security."
  },
  {
    question: "Why is mechanization in agriculture sometimes viewed as a cause of rural unemployment?",
    options: [
      "Increases dependence on seasonal labor",
      "Replaces manual labor leading to job losses",
      "Requires low capital investment",
      "Lowers productivity"
    ],
    answer: 1,
    explanation: "Mechanization replaces manual labor which can reduce demand for farm workers and cause unemployment."
  },
  {
    question: "What role do MSMEs play in India's export sector?",
    options: [
      "Negligible contribution",
      "Major contributor providing significant exports",
      "Only contribute to domestic market",
      "Limited to raw material production"
    ],

      "Low GDP growth",
      "High unemployment"
    ],
    answer: 1,
    explanation: "Inequality arises mainly due to uneven access to quality education, healthcare, and jobs."
  },

    options: [
      "By guaranteeing minimum wage employment for rural households",
      "By providing loans to farmers",
      "By creating urban jobs",
      "By increasing agricultural output"
    ],
    answer: 0,
    explanation: "MGNREGA guarantees 100 days of wage employment to rural households to improve their livelihood security."
  },
  {
    question: "Why does the manufacturing sector have a multiplier effect on the Indian economy?",
    options: [
      "It employs only skilled labor",
      "It generates demand for raw materials, machinery and services",
      "It relies solely on exports",
      "It is limited to large cities"
    ],
    answer: 1,
    explanation: "Manufacturing stimulates other sectors by increasing demand for inputs and services, creating more jobs."
  },
  {
    question: "How can inflation impact economic growth?",
    options: [
      "Always promotes growth by increasing demand",
      "Can reduce growth by eroding purchasing power and investment",
      "Has no impact on growth",
      "Only benefits exporters"
    ],
