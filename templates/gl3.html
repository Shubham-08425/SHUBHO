  },
  {
    question: "Why does the eastern coastal plain of India receive more rainfall than the western coastal plain?",
    options: [
      "Proximity to the Bay of Bengal and moisture-laden northeast monsoon winds",
      "Presence of Western Ghats blocking rainfall",
      "Higher altitude of the eastern plains",
      "Presence of thick forests in the east"

    options: [
      "Weathering of basaltic lava",
      "Deposition of sediments by rivers originating from the Himalayas",
      "Formation from volcanic ash deposits",
      "Accumulation of decayed organic matter"
    ],
    answer: 1,
    explanation: "Alluvial soil is formed from sediments deposited by rivers from the Himalayas."
  },
  {
    question: "What is the major reason behind the high seismic activity in the Himalayan region?",
    options: [
      "Volcanic eruptions under the mountains",
      "Continuous collision and subduction of Indian and Eurasian plates",
      "Presence of large underground caves ",
      "Tectonic stability due to thick crust"
    ],
    answer: 1,
    explanation: "The Himalayas lie in an active collision zone between the Indian and Eurasian plates, causing frequent earthquakes."
  },
  {
    question: "Which river basin in India is known for extensive black soil, also called 'Regur' soil?",
    options: [
      "Godavari basin",
      "Mahanadi basin",
      "Narmada basin",
