      "Wheat",
      "Rice",
      "Sugarcane",
      "Cotton"
    ],
    answer: 0,
    explanation: "Wheat growth requires cool temperatures; hence temperature limits its distribution more than rainfall."
  },

    options: [
      "Overgrazing by livestock",
      "Deforestation",
      "Heavy annual rainfall",
      "Unsustainable agricultural practices"
    ],
    answer: 2,
    explanation: "Heavy rainfall reduces desertification; it is not a contributing factor."
  },
  {
    question: "Why are the Western Ghats considered an important barrier to the southwest monsoon winds?",
    options: [
      "They reduce wind speed causing orographic rainfall",
      "They deflect the monsoon winds towards the east coast",
      "They have snow-covered peaks that block the wind",
      "They have volcanic activity heating the air"
    ],
    answer: 0,
    explanation: "Western Ghats force moist winds upward causing heavy rainfall on the windward side."
  },
  {
    question: "Which of the following best explains the reason for the formation of oxbow lakes?",
    options: [
      "Deposition of silt on riverbanks",
      "Flooding in the river basin",
      "Erosion and cutting off of a meander loop in a mature river",
      "Glacial melting"
    ],
    answer: 2,
    explanation: "Oxbow lakes form when a meander loop is cut off by the river due to erosion."
  },
  {
    question: "Which river system in India is mainly fed by glacier melt rather than rainfall?",
    options: [
      "Godavari",
      "Brahmaputra",
      "Krishna",
      "Narmada"
    ],
    answer: 1,
    explanation: "The Brahmaputra is largely glacier-fed from the Himalayas."
  },
  {
    question: "Why does the Deccan Plateau experience scarcity of surface water despite receiving moderate rainfall?",
    options: [
      "Permeable basalt rock allows rapid percolation of water",
      "High evaporation rate",
      "Lack of rivers originating in the plateau",
      "Extensive forest cover"
    ],
    answer: 0,
    explanation: "Basalt rock in Deccan Plateau is porous, causing quick water percolation and less surface water."
  },
  {
    question: "Which of the following is a major consequence of deforestation in the Himalayan region?",
    options: [
      "Decrease in soil erosion",
      "Frequent landslides and flash floods",
      "Increase in wildlife habitats",
      "Rise in groundwater levels"
    ],
    answer: 1,
    explanation: "Deforestation destabilizes slopes leading to landslides and floods."
  },
  {
    question: "Why is the coastal plain of Gujarat referred to as the 'Rann of Kutch'?",
    options: [
      "Due to presence of salt marshes and seasonal flooding",
      "Because of dense mangrove forests",
      "It is a major fishing hub",
      "It is a volcanic plateau"
    ],
    answer: 0,
    explanation: "The Rann of Kutch is a salt marsh area prone to flooding."
  },
  {
    question: "Which soil type is predominant in the Indo-Gangetic plains and why is it suitable for agriculture?",
    options: [
      "Black soil due to moisture retention",
      "Laterite soil due to iron content",
      "Alluvial soil due to nutrient-rich sediments deposited by rivers",
      "Red soil due to presence of oxides"
    ],
    answer: 2,
    explanation: "Alluvial soil is fertile and nutrient-rich, ideal for farming."
  },
  {
    question: "What makes the climate of Ladakh extremely cold and arid?",

      "High altitude and rain shadow effect by the Himalayas",
      "Proximity to the Bay of Bengal",
      "Dense forest cover",
      "Low latitude near the equator"
    ],
    answer: 0,
    explanation: "Ladakh is cold and dry due to altitude and rain shadow."
  },
  {
    question: "Why are mangrove forests mostly found in the Sundarbans region of India?",
    options: [
      "Saline water and tidal influence create favorable conditions",
      "Low temperatures and snowfall",
      "Sandy soil and heavy rainfall",
      "High altitude and low humidity"

      "Kosi, due to frequent floods and changing course",
      "Ganga, due to high pollution levels",
      "Yamuna, because of droughts",
      "Chambal, due to flash floods"
    ],
    answer: 0,
    explanation: "Kosi causes devastating floods due to its shifting course."

      "Causes significant cooling due to increased greenery",
      "Decreases air pollution",
      "Has no impact on temperature or rainfall"
    ],
    answer: 0,
    explanation: "Urban areas absorb heat, creating heat islands raising local temperatures."
  },
  {
    question: "Which of the following best describes the impact of the monsoon trough on Indian weather?",
    options: [
      "It causes droughts in northern India",
      "It acts as a low-pressure zone leading to heavy rainfall and cyclones",
      "It blocks monsoon winds completely",
      "It is responsible for snowfall in the Himalayas"
    ],
    answer: 1,
    explanation: "Monsoon trough is a low-pressure area causing heavy rains and sometimes cyclones."
